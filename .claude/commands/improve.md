# Improve Command

**Purpose**: Systematic code improvement with measurable enhancements

**Auto-Activations**:
- Persona: refactorer, performance, architect, qa (context-dependent)
- MCP: Sequential (analysis), Context7 (best practices), Magic (UI improvements)
- Flags: --validate, --loop (iterative improvement), --think

**Arguments**:
- `$ARGUMENTS` - Target for improvement
- `@<path>` - Specific path to improve
- `--focus <area>` - performance | quality | security | architecture | accessibility
- `--scope <level>` - file | module | project | system
- `--iterations <n>` - Number of improvement cycles (default: 3)
- `--interactive` - Confirm between iterations

**Improvement Workflow**:
1. 📊 **Baseline Measurement**: Establish current metrics and quality scores
2. 🔍 **Issue Identification**: Analyze code for improvement opportunities
3. 🎯 **Prioritization**: Rank improvements by impact and effort
4. 🛠️ **Implementation**: Apply improvements systematically
5. ✅ **Validation**: Verify improvements with metrics
6. 🔄 **Iteration**: Repeat for progressive enhancement
7. 📝 **Documentation**: Record improvements and learnings

**Quality Metrics**:
- Code Complexity: Cyclomatic complexity, cognitive load
- Maintainability Index: Readability, documentation, consistency
- Performance: Speed, memory usage, resource efficiency
- Security: Vulnerability count, compliance score
- Test Coverage: Unit, integration, E2E coverage

**Iterative Enhancement**:
- Wave-enabled for comprehensive improvements
- Progressive refinement with validation gates
- Evidence-based optimization with before/after metrics

**Quality Standards**:
- Measurable improvements with metrics validation
- No regression in existing functionality
- Comprehensive testing of changes

**Examples**:
- `/improve @src/api --focus performance --iterations 3`
- `/improve --scope project --focus quality --interactive`
- `/improve @components/DataTable --focus accessibility`

Execute improvement following SuperClaude refactorer persona with simplicity-first approach.
